Before you begin to play you must recruit a warband to take part
in the battle for Mordheim. The warbands are represented by a whole
range of Citadel models available as boxed sets and blister packs. The
boxed sets are designed to form an ideal starting point for your collection
and further models can be added as your warband grows and thrives. 
In this section of the book
we take a detailed look at
each of the warbands and
provide the information you
need to recruit a warband of
that type.
Use the lists that follow to recruit
and equip your warband (an
example warband has been
included at the back of the book.)
You have 500 gold crowns to spend. Each model
and their equipment (if you choose to buy any) costs
a set amount of money. As you make your choices,
subtract the money you have “spent” from your total
until you have bought all you can. Any unspent gold
crowns are put into the warband’s treasury and can
be used later or hoarded to buy something more
expensive.
To start with you must recruit at least three warriors
including a leader. The weapons, armour and
mutations you choose for your warriors must be
represented on the models themselves. The
exceptions are knives and daggers, which you may
assume are tucked in boots or concealed in clothing
if not represented on the model.
skill tables
and starting experience
The warband lists also include information about the
starting experience of the warriors and which skills
they can choose as they progress in the game. Some
warbands also include separate skill lists unique to
the warband.
The rules about experience and skills will be fully
explained in the Campaign section, so don’t worry
about them for now.
Starting a warband

heroes and henchmen
For game purposes the warriors in your warband are
classified as Heroes and Henchmen.
heroes
These are exceptional individuals who have the
potential to become legends. Heroes can be armed
and equipped individually and may carry any special
equipment they might pick up during the campaign.
leader
Every warband must have a leader. He represents you,
the player. He makes the decisions and leads your
warriors through the dark streets of Mordheim.
other heroes
Apart from its leader, your warband may include up to
five other Heroes, who form the core of your
warband. A warband may never include more Heroes
of any specific type than the number given in the
Warband list. This means that some warbands can
only get the maximum of six Heroes by gaining
experience with their Henchmen (see the Experience
section).
henchmen
Henchmen typically fall into two groups. There are
Henchmen such as the Brethren of the Possessed,
Skaven Verminkin and Mercenary Swordsmen. These
Henchmen gain experience and become better as
time goes by. They are bought in groups of one to five
models.


--- Page 2 ---
33 33 33
The other type of Henchmen are those such as
Warhounds and Zombies. These are too dim or too
primitive to gain experience.
Henchmen may never use any special equipment you
acquire during their adventures (unless otherwise
noted); only Heroes may do so. Henchmen can
include potentially powerful warriors, but Heroes
always have an edge over them with their potential to
gain extra experience.
All Henchmen belong to a Henchmen group , which
usually consists of between one and five individuals.
Henchmen groups gain experience collectively and
gain advances together.
weapons and armour
Each warrior you recruit can be armed with up to two
close combat weapons (in addition to his free
dagger), up to two different missile weapons and any
armour chosen from the appropriate list. For these
purposes, a brace of pistols counts as a single missile
weapon. Warriors may be restricted in regard to
which types of weapons they can use. The warband’s
equipment lists tell you exactly what equipment is
available. Note that you may buy rare weapons and
armour when starting a warband, as indicated by the
list in the warband’s entry, but after playing the first
game the only way to get further rare weapons and
armour is to roll to see if you can locate them (see the
Trading section). 
You may buy additional equipment between battles,
but your warriors can only use the weapons and
armour listed in their warband entry. As they
accumulate experience and gain skills, Heroes may
learn to use weapons other than those initially
available to them.
Every model in each Henchman group must be armed
and armoured in the same way. This means that if
your Henchman group has four warriors, and you
want to buy them swords, you must buy four swords.
warband roster
You’ll need a warband roster sheet to record the
details of your warband. Blank roster sheets can be
found printed at the back of this book, one for Heroes
and one for Henchman groups. We suggest that you
photocopy or copy as many sheets as you need, so
that you can keep a neat and accurate record of your
warband as it changes from game to game.
When you choose a warband, take a warband roster
sheet and write down the details of each Hero and
Henchman group in the appropriate places. You’ll
notice that Heroes and Henchmen have slightly
different spaces provided to reflect the different ways
Warbands
3
in which they gain experience and use weapons,
armour and equipment.
It is a good idea to work out the warband on a piece
of scrap paper first, as you will have to juggle the
weapons and fighters to get as close to the maximum
permitted value of the warband as possible. If you
have any cash left after choosing your warband write
this down in the space marked as ‘Treasury’. At the
end of the book you’ll find an example warband; you
can use this if you want or choose your own – it’s up
to you.
The warband roster is a record of your brave group of
warriors and is useful to keep beside you as you play.
During a battle you may wish to make notes on the
sheet itself, to record details such as extra experience,
equipment used, etc.
You will need to give your warband a name, and also
name all your Heroes and each Henchman group. It’s
up to you to invent suitable names, though you’ll find
plenty of inspiration throughout this book.
calculate the warband rating
Each warband has a warband rating – the higher the
rating, the better the warband. The warband rating is
simply the number of warriors multiplied by 5, plus
their accumulated experience.
Large creatures such as Rat Ogres are worth 20 points
plus the number of Experience points they have
accumulated.
ready for battle
The warband is now ready to start its fighting career!

“L
isten to me boy, there are many in Mordheim who you
must face. Men from the lands of Middenheim to as far
as Marienburg have staked their claim upon this forsaken city.
Then there are the rat-men, the Walking Dead and those
crazed Witch Hunters…
So seeing as I’m feeling generous, I will describe them all.
Then maybe you’ll have an idea of what you’re up against. 
So pay attention boy, for this information just might save 
your life!”
Warbands
The Cult of the Possessed
The Possessed. The Damned. The bogeymen. These scum are the
worst of the worst. They are dangerous creatures, perhaps more so
than any other group in the entire city. This Chaos-worshipping
scum consists of mutants, Beastmen and cultists, and even worse
things called the Possessed. If you ever let them get close to you,
you’ll be in big trouble – there are few who are a match for this
scum in close quarters.
Witch Hunters
Witch Hunters will burn you and your warband if you give them the slightest reason. They are well
armed and equipped, and show no mercy to anyone who dares to stand in their way. They are
followed everywhere in Mordheim by a rabble of fanatics and those crazed Flagellants. One word
from a Witch Hunter and they’ll tear you apart, burn you, decapitate you and excommunicate you
from the grace of Sigmar.
The Undead
The Restless Dead plague Mordheim. Zombies, Ghouls and huge
hellhounds prowl the streets, and woe to anyone caught by them. He’ll
be eaten alive, or end up as one of the walking corpses himself. I lost
my eye to one of the fanged horrors who leads the Undead. Let me tell
you, that thing was not human. I put my sword through it and it still
kept coming.

Warbands

“S
o there you have it. You’ll encounter all these motley crews in
Mordheim sooner or later. Each has its own weaknessess but each also
has its strengths that you must learn to deal with. Remember, it is foolish
to rush into close combat with the Possessed scum – you’ll only get killed.
Neither should you try to outpace the Skaven vermin, for they’re as fast as
quicksilver. 
If you heed nothing else, lad, remember this. Make your warband as flexible
as possible so that you are prepared for almost anything this cursed city
will throw at you.
Skaven
These are no ordinary vermin - big as a man,
fast on their feet, and smart too, not like
common rats. The whole city’s full of ’em
and the worse of it is they’re waitin’ in the
old drains and sewers, watchin’ for a chance
to catch you on your own. Let ’em and you’re
a dead man. 
Sisters of Sigmar
Don’t believe everything those Witch Hunters
say about the Sisters. They’re no more
heretics than I am and I’ll skewer any man
that says different. Not that the Sisters need
looking after – they’re mean fighters and you
gotta be tough just to live like they do in
that big fortress in the middle of Mordheim. 
Reiklanders
Ah, Reiklanders, the finest of men! Disciplined, magnificent archers and
good, solid warriors! Reiklanders need the best leaders, so you’d better
shape up boy! For these warriors are good at almost all the skills of war,
and they are more likely to hold their nerve than others in Mordheim. 
Marienburgers
The rich boys of Marienburg. Never turn your back on them. I’ll grant
them this: they are completely ruthless and have more money than anyone
else – hardly surprising, as those fat leeches in the Merchant’s Guild fill
their coffers. That’s why they have such good armour and weapons, and
usually a few more men than most as well. Don’t let their fancy clothes
and flash jewellery fool you, though. They’re not wearing those weapons
just for show, they know how to use them as well!
Middenheimers
These Northerners are nutters, madmen, berserkers! They are as strong as
Ogres and meaner than Orcs. Watch out for them in close quarters – the
chances are they’ll crush your skull with a hammer or behead you with
one of those hefty axes they carry around with them.


--- Page 5 ---
This is a time of
unremitting war, civil
strife, violence and
famine. A time of orphan
children and wanton
slaughter. For warriors
these are good times! Since
the discovery of wyrdstone
Mordheim has become a
magnet for fighting men from
all over the Empire. Nobles,
merchants, and the Temple of
Sigmar itself offer rich rewards for shards of the
mysterious stone. Foremost amongst the patrons of
mercenary warriors are the
three most powerful contenders for the Emperor’s
throne: the Grand Prince of Reikland, the Count of
Middenheim, and Lady Magritta of Marienburg –
favourite of the merchant guilds.
As a mercenary warband you must decide which of
the three contenders for Sigmar’s throne you are
fighting for. Warbands from different places will vary
in many respects, offering different benefits as well as
having a unique appearance and character. 
Reikland
Reikland lies at the heart of the Empire and its
greatest city is Altdorf, home of the Grand Theogonist
and seat of the Temple of Sigmar. Reiklanders are
devout followers of Sigmar, the founder, first
Emperor, and patron god of the Empire. The Grand
Prince of Reikland (as Siegfried, the ruler of Reikland,
styles himself) is supported in his claim to the throne
by the Grand Theogonist and opposed most strongly
by the Count of Middenheim and the Priests of Ulric. 
Throughout the Empire Reiklanders are commonly
supposed to embody the discipline and loyalty of the
professional warrior. Brave and well-versed in the
arts of war, Reiklanders disdain fashionable clothing
in favour of well-made and practical wargear.
In battle they often wear coloured ribbons as
marks of identification or authority. They are
justly proud of their dynamic and ambitious
Grand Prince and contemptuous of other claimants
to the throne, especially the Count of Middenheim,
Mannfred Todbringer, whom they sneeringly call the
‘lap-dog of Ulric’. 
special rules
Reikland Mercenaries are accustomed to the
demands of military discipline and have a strongly
developed loyalty between officers and men. To
represent this, fighters may use their Captain’s
Leadership if within 12" rather than the usual 6". 
A strong tradition of martial training is also
responsible for the high standards of archery
amongst the people of Reikland. All Marksmen
therefore add +1 to their Ballistic Skill,
whether they are recruited when the warband
is first formed or added later.
Mercenaries

--- Page 6 ---
Middenheim
Middenheim stands on a mountain pinnacle
surrounded by dark forest in the centre of
Middenland, and is also known as the City of the
White Wolf after Ulric, the old god of wolves and
winter. The Priesthood of Ulric is still strong in
Middenheim where Ulric is venerated as the patron of
the city. The tradition of rivalry between Middenheim
and Reikland goes back hundreds of years, and the
Count of Middenheim, Mannfred Todbringer, is one
of the chief contenders for the Emperor’s throne. As a
result there has always been a great deal of friction
between Middenheimers and the Temple of Sigmar. 
Middenheimers are typically large, strongly built men
with a well deserved reputation for ferocity. Many
wear wolf pelts which custom decrees to be the mark
of those who have slain a wolf with their own hands.
These grim warriors are famously contemptuous of
danger. They frequently go into battle bare-headed,
scoffing at those who choose, for reasons of good
sense, to wear helmets. As Middenheimers favour
long hair and beards their lack of headgear makes
them look especially fierce when they charge upon
their enemies howling their brutal battle-cries. 
special rules
The men of Middenheim are famous for their physical
prowess. To represent their advantage in size and
bulk, the Champions and Captains of a Middenheim
warband start with Strength 4 instead of Strength 3.
Marienburg
Marienburg is the largest and most prosperous
trading city in the Old World. Many call it the City of
Gold which alone conveys a good idea of the wealth
of this sprawling cosmopolitan city. Nowhere else can
be found the vast array of shops selling goods from as
far away as the Elven kingdoms of Ulthuan in the west
and distant Cathay in the east. The city’s craftsmen
represent every skill known to man, and a few others
beside, so that it is said in Marienburg there is no
activity that cannot be quickly turned to profit. 
Many mercantile guilds have their headquarters in
Marienburg, most important of all the secretive High
Order of Honourable Freetraders which represents
the elite amongst mercantile society. This large, rich,
and ambitious body of men feel themselves shackled
by the old order and are eager to seize power for
themselves. Their champion for the Emperor’s throne
is the Lady Magritta. Thanks to the unseen influence
of Freetraders throughout the Empire all the minor
Electors were persuaded to support the Lady
Magritta’s claim. It was only the Grand
Theogonist’s refusal to crown her that denied
77
Marienburg the throne driving a wedge between the
City of Gold and the Temple of Sigmar.
Warbands sent to Mordheim are sumptuously dressed
and armed. Though Marienburgers are often
ridiculed as foppish and effete, their skill at arms and
complete ruthlessness has earned them grudging
respect. Their chief skills lie in duelling and in the use
of poisons and other clandestine fighting methods.
Richer individuals dress flamboyantly and wear
jewellery. However, the bulk of most warbands are
recruited from the dockland thugs, ships’ crews, and
stevedores who favour a simpler appearance: leather
coats, bandanas and short swords that are easy to
conceal.
special rules
As natural traders with contacts in the merchant
guilds Marienburg warbands receive a +1 bonus
when attempting to find rare items (see the Trading
section for rules).
To reflect their enormous wealth Marienburgers start
off with an extra 100 gold crowns (600 in total) when
fighting in a campaign. In a one-off game they are
permitted an extra 20% gold crowns when recruiting
a warband. For example, in a 1,000 gold crown game
a Marienburger warband will have 1,200gc.
Choice of warriors
A Mercenary warband must include a minimum of
three models. You have 500 gold crowns available to
spend. The maximum number of warriors in the
warband may never exceed 15.
Captain: Each Mercenary warband must have
one Captain: no more, no less!
Champions: Your warband may include up to two
Champions.
Youngbloods: Your warband may include up to two
Youngbloods.
Warriors: Your warband may include any number of
Warriors.
Marksmen: Your warband may include no more
than seven Marksmen.
Swordsmen: Your warband may include no
more than five Swordsmen.
Starting experience
The Captain starts with 20 experience.
Champions start with 8 experience.
Youngbloods start with 0 experience.
Henchmen start with 0 experience.

There is never
any shortage of men willing
to risk their lives for a chance
of real power: men whose
ambitions lie beyond the scope
of their birthright, or whose
sorcerous skills or physical
deformities place them in constant
danger of persecution. What do such men
have to lose if they pledge their souls to the
dark gods of Chaos! In the aftermath of the
destruction of Mordheim all manner of mutants have
appeared whilst many hitherto unblemished folk feel
the stirring of strange powers, the first awakenings of
magical gifts destined to bring them to a fiery death at
the hands of the Witch Hunters.
Now a leader has appeared, a new Dark Emperor,
who claims lordship of the City of the Damned. He is
called the Shadowlord, Master of the Possessed, and
followers of the cults of Chaos gather from all over
the Empire to pledge their souls to him. Though none
know whether he is man or Daemon all proclaim him
their saviour and eagerly seek to do his bidding. 
As all students of the dark arts know, it is by the power
of magic that creatures such as Daemons and spirits
are able to stalk the mortal world. The wyrdstone that
proliferates in Mordheim grants unnatural life to
many vile things that by all natural rights should never
exist. The Possessed were once men but by
surrendering themselves wholly to the dark gods they
have allowed Daemons to possess their bodies. Their
appearance is horrific – corrupted from within, their
flesh is twisted into a new and monstrous form. 
With the power of the Possessed behind them the
followers of the Shadowlord have grown powerful in
Mordheim. In the Massacre of Silver Street the Cult of
the Possessed ambushed and destroyed a large force
sent in to hunt them down. Now the streets of
Mordheim belong to the Shadowlord and his
servants. The contaminated air does not affect them at
all or, more likely, it nourishes their inner corruption.
Men who venture into Mordheim alone are hunted
down and sacrificed to the dark gods. All warbands of
the Possessed gather wyrdstone for the Shadowlord
who remains hidden in the Pit where he is said to be
guarded by titanic Possessed the size of houses. A few
shards of the precious stone are kept by the warbands
and used to create more of the Possessed.
Cult of the possessed
The leaders of cult warbands are called Magisters and
each leads a group of cultists: minions of the dark
gods of Chaos. These are men whose hunger for
power knows no bounds, who willingly give their
bodies over to possession. All take part in the blood
sacrifices, dark rituals, and worship of Daemons –
nothing is too base for them! These degenerate
humans are joined by other creatures as vile as they –
things half-man half-beast that call themselves Gors,
and which men refer to as Beastmen. 
There are few sights as horrific as a cult warband.
Deranged warriors smeared with blood and dirt wave
jagged weapons and chant blasphemous rites as they
throw themselves upon their foes. Many are hardly
recognisable as human, their bodies are so scarred
and disfigured. The stigmata of mutation is borne by
most, but the most unsettling of all are the Possessed
themselves – melded flesh made of men, beasts, and
metal driven by the implacable will of a Daemon. 
Choice of warriors
A Possessed warband must include a minimum of
three models. You have 500 gold crowns to recruit
your initial warband. The maximum number of
warriors in the warband may never exceed 15.
Magister: Each Possessed warband must have one
Magister: no more, no less!
Possessed: Your warband may include up
to two Possessed.
Mutants: Your warband may include up to
two Mutants. 
Darksouls: Your warband may include up to five
Darksouls.
Brethren: Any number of models may be Brethren.
Beastmen: Your warband may include up to three
Beastmen Gors.

A Magister starts with 20 experience.
Possessed start with 8 experience.
Mutants starts with 0 experience.

hen you are facing an enemy that is really

0-2 The possessed
90 gold crowns to hire
(+ the cost of mutations)
The Possessed have committed the greatest of
heresies: they have given their bodies to Daemons. As
a result, they are nightmarish creatures, a melding of
flesh, metal and black magic. Inside them lives a
supernatural thing of evil, a Daemon from the dark
reaches of the Realm of Chaos.
The powerful spirit of a Daemon can meld several
creatures together, be they men or animals, into a
multi-faceted horror. These monstrous Possessed are
perhaps the most dangerous of the creatures of
Mordheim, and certainly the most loathsome and
dreadful.

Beastmen are mutated monstrosities that infest

Darksouls are men who have been driven insane by
the daemonic possession which became all too
common after the destruction of Mordheim. The
Daemons have left the bodies of these men, but their
minds have been scarred by the horror of the
experience. 
Their insane strength makes Darksouls dangerous
fighters. The Cultists regard them as holy men, and let
them work out their unreasoning rage in battle. In
their tortured minds the Darksouls believe
themselves to be Daemons. They wear leering
daemonic masks and garb themselves in armour and
clothing resembling the scaled skin of Daemons.

Mutations
Cult of the possessed
Mutations may be bought for a Mutant or a Possessed
warrior only when they are recruited; you may not
buy new mutations for a model after recruitment. Any
Mutant or Possessed may have one or more
mutations. The first mutation is bought at the price
indicated, but second and subsequent mutations
bought for the same model cost double.
Those who dwell in Mordheim soon develop horrible
mutations, and the Cult of the Possessed seem to be
especially susceptible. In addition, Mordheim attracts
mutants from all over the Empire, who are always
quick to join the Chaos covens. Most mutations are
simply inconvenient or hideous, but some make their
bearers extremely dangerous in combat.
daemon soul
A Daemon lives within the mutant’s soul. This gives
him a 4+ save against the effects of spells or prayers.
Cost: 20 gold crowns.
great claw
One of the mutant’s arms ends in a great, crab-like
claw. He may carry no weapons in this arm, but gains
an extra attack in hand-to-hand combat with a +1
Strength bonus.
Cost: 50 gold crowns.
cloven hoofs
The warrior gains +1
Movement.
Cost: 40 gold
crowns
tentacle
One of the mutant’s arms ends in a tentacle. He may
grapple his opponent in close combat to reduce his
attacks by -1, down to a minimum of 1. The mutant
may decide which attack his opponent loses.
Cost: 35 gold crowns
blackblood
If the model loses a wound in close combat, anyone
in base contact with the model suffers a Strength 3 hit
(no critical hits) from the spurting corrosive blood.
Cost: 30 gold crowns
spines
Any model in base contact with the mutant suffers an
automatic Strength 1 hit at the beginning of each
close combat phase. Spines will never cause critical
hits.
Cost: 35 gold crowns
scorpion tail
The mutant has a long barbed tail with a venomed tip,
allowing him to make an extra Strength 5 attack in
each hand-to-hand combat phase. If the model hit by
the tail is immune to poison, the Strength of
the hit is reduced to 2.
Cost: 40 gold crowns
extra arm
The mutant may use any single-handed weapon
in the extra arm, giving him +1 attack when fighting
in hand-to-hand combat. Alternatively, he may carry a
shield or a buckler in the extra arm. If a Possessed
chooses to do this, he gains an extra attack but still
cannot carry a weapon.
Cost: 40 gold crowns
hideous
The mutant causes fear. See the Psychology section
for details.

vicious warhounds which the Witch Hunters employ
to track and bring down fugitives. 
As men accustomed to fighting Witch Hunters are
well-armed and sturdy individuals. They favour
hooded cloaks and headgear which conceal their
appearance from the overly curious. Some wear
chains about their throats to remind them of fallen
comrades and old rivalries and also, so it is said, so
that the iron might serve as protection against
witchcraft. 
The followers of the Witch Hunters, the rabble that
accompany  them to Mordheim, are a far more dire
sight indeed – crazed and self-mutilated men who
have lost or surrendered all their worldly goods and,
most likely, their reason as well. 
Choice of warriors
A Witch Hunter warband must include a minimum of
three models. You have 500 gold crowns which you
can use to recruit your initial warband. The maximum
number of warriors in the warband may never exceed
12.
Witch Hunter Captain: Each Witch Hunter warband
must have one Witch Hunter Captain.
Warrior-Priest: Your warband may
include a single Warrior-Priest.
Witch Hunters: Your warband may

Witch hunters
he Order of the Templars of Sigmar, universally
known as the Witch Hunters, is an organisation
dedicated to the eradication of heretics, be they
warlocks, witches, sorcerers, fortune-tellers,
necromancers, worshippers of the dark gods,
deviants, mutants, blasphemers, sinners, utterers of
profanities, servants of Daemons, or composers of
corrupting music. Indeed, there are few who
altogether escape the suspicions of the Witch Hunters
with the possible exception of other Witch Hunters. 
It is wise to remember that the practice of magic in all
its forms is deemed a most heinous crime in the
Empire. Death by fire is the proscribed punishment
for this particular heresy. Many of the Witch Hunters’
victims treacherously avoid their fate by perishing
under torture before making a full confession. In
these troubled times the Witch Hunters are kept busy
as more and more men turn to the dark arts. The most
dangerous of all these heretics are the followers of the
Chaos gods. These depraved individuals practise
Daemon worship and (it is claimed) even offer human
sacrifices in the name of their vile masters. Of all the
enemies of Sigmar they are the most abhorrent! 
The destruction of Mordheim has fired the Witch
Hunters with a new and irresistible sense of purpose.
In the light of events the Grand Theogonist has
proclaimed Sigmar’s punishment on the City of the
Damned. The Witch Hunters rejoice that their crusade
against widespread corruption has been vindicated.
Now they are ready to complete Sigmar’s holy
purpose by destroying his enemies within the ruins of
the city itself. The Grand Theogonist has commanded
the Witch Hunters to go unto that place and recover
the wyrdstone for Sigmar’s temple. Their crusade also
pits them into the same arena as their old enemies the
so-called Sisters of Sigmar – those loathsome
Daemon-worshipping she-heretics whose very
existence is a vile affront to the majesty of Sigmar. 
Witch Hunters are charismatic rabble-rousers who can
soon turn a crowd to their own ends. They are
universally dreaded, for everyone has something or
someone to hide, and there are countless individuals
who would willingly and enthusiastically hunt down
and burn their own kin were a Witch Hunter
to command them to do so. Bands of Witch
Hunters are often accompanied by
zealous citizens, Flagellants, and even
holy Priests of Sigmar as well as the huge

their rousing speeches, Witch Hunters can muster
these dangerous lunatics to fight in the streets of
Mordheim, where no sane man dares tread.
Flagellants are extremely dangerous opponents in
close combat, for they have the strength of madmen,

of self-mutilation.

When a man loses his family, home and all he cared
for, religion is often the last refuge left to him. Such
men become wandering pilgrims, bitter and
dangerous fanatics who are prepared to avenge their
loss at any cost. These men are called Zealots. 
Zealots have forsaken their former lives and exist only
to destroy evil and the minions of Chaos. Whilst they
might have been peasants and craftsmen before, and
thus may not be as dangerous in a fight as seasoned
mercenaries, their determination and fanaticism
should not be underestimated. Witch Hunters find
ready allies in their ranks, and many a band of Zealots
is led by Witch Hunters.

The Sisters of Sigmar
or centuries the nobility of the Empire has sent
its wayward or troublesome daughters to the
Holy Convent of the Order of Merciful Sisters of
Sigmar in Mordheim to be initiated into the only
order of priestesses dedicated to the Empire’s patron
god. The Sisters of Sigmar, as they are commonly
called, have traditionally travelled the Empire
administering to the sick and poor, tending to the
needs of orphans, curing the diseased and mending
broken bodies. As well as the healing arts, which they
practise with expert knowledge of herb-lore and
prayer, their advice is frequently sought by those
about to make an important decision, for the Sisters
of Sigmar are famed for their ability to predict the
fickle course of fate. 
Though once much loved by the common people, the
Sisters have seen their popularity wane in recent
years. Rabble-rousing Witch Hunters have denounced
them as witches and heretics, so that even in the
countryside they are attacked and driven away by the
very peasants they seek to help. Many of Sigmar’s
priests wish to disband the order altogether, claiming
that women have no right to teach the holy word of
Sigmar. Even the Grand Theogonist, ostensibly the
chief authority over the order, has cooled towards the
sisterhood, denying the throne to Magritta of
Marienburg who was brought up by the Sisters and
said to be sympathetic to their cause. These days the
Sisters of Sigmar have retreated to their convent
situated high on the craggy island of Sigmar’s Rock in
the river Stir in Mordheim. 
Of all the inhabitants of Mordheim only the Sisters of
Sigmar were prepared for its destruction. Seeress
Cassandora foretold of the disaster and at their
nightly vigil the Maidens of Sigmar heard the voice of
Sigmar speaking in their dreaming minds. Thus they
knew that they would be safe in their fortress high
above the city, raised as it is above the polluted
vapours, if only they were prepared to survive the fire
of Sigmar’s Fury. 
While the rest of Mordheim fell under a spell of
madness the Sisters of Sigmar offered prayer after
prayer, scourging themselves to drive out all thoughts
of sin, fervently accepting a punishing penitential
regime to harden their minds against the wantonness
running rampant outside their walls. When the blow
finally came the Sisters gathered beneath the great
temple dome of their convent which, well built and
fortified as it was by the prayers of the Sisters,
protected them from the fire and heat of their
master’s ire. 
The Sisters believe they have a holy mission, a task
that they have been set by Sigmar himself and to
which they must submit themselves body and soul.
Their sacred duty is to gather up the shards of
wyrdstone and hide it deep beneath Sigmar’s Rock in
the vaults of their convent where, shielded by a great
depth of solid granite and guarded by the eternal
prayers of the sisterhood, it will cause no harm to
Sigmar’s people. It is a nigh hopeless task, for there
are few Sisters and countless shards of stone. Worse
still, there are many who want the stone for
themselves, to take it from Mordheim and spread its
contagion amongst the cities of the Empire.  
The warbands of the sisterhood are led by tough
Matriarchs, each accompanied by a body of warrior
sisters. The training and harsh discipline of the
convent includes mastery of martial as well as
ecclesiastic skills, for mastery of the body is but the
first step towards the mastery of the soul. Their
favoured weapon is the warhammer, the instrument
of Sigmar, seen as his holy symbol, alongside the twin-
tailed comet. 
Choice of warriors
A Sisters of Sigmar warband must include a minimum
of three models. You have 500 gold crowns to recruit
your initial warband. The maximum number of
warriors in the warband may never exceed 15.
Sigmarite Matriarch: Each Sisters of Sigmar

Sisters of Sigmar
Sign of Sigmar
The Sister is favoured by the great god Sigmar.
Possessed or Undead opponents lose their first attack
against the Priestess in the first round of hand-to-hand
combat (down to a minimum of 1).
Protection of Sigmar
The Sister has been blessed by the High Matriarch.
Any spell which would affect her is nullified on a D6
roll of 4+. Note that if the spell is nullified it will not
affect any other models either.
Utter Determination
Only the Matriarch may have this skill, which allows
her to re-roll any failed Rout tests.
Righteous Fury
The Sister feels cold fury and utter contempt towards
any evil that pollutes the soil of the holy Empire with
its presence. The model hates all Skaven, Undead or
Possessed warbands and all models in them.
Absolute Faith
The Sister puts her faith in Sigmar, and faces dangers
unflinchingly. She may re-roll any Fear tests and does
not have to test if she is fighting alone against several
opponents.

In addition, an Augur can use her Blessed Sight to
help the Sisterhood when they are searching the

0-10 Novices

By tradition, the Sisters draw their recruits only from
the most noble houses of the Empire, and families
consider it a great honour to have their daughter
accepted into the order. Only maidens of noble
lineage can be relied upon to have the devotion to
duty and innate sense of honour. Few though the
recruits may be, they must endure several years as
Novices during which time their devotion will be
tested to the full. All are eager to prove themselves
worthy to be the handmaidens of Sigmar.

sigmarite warhammer

One of the traditional weapons of the
Sisterhood, the warhammer echoes Ghal-Maraz,
the great hammer of Sigmar himself.
Range Strength Special rules
Close Com As user+1 Concussion, Holy
SPECIAL RULES
Concussion: Warhammers are excellent at
striking people senseless. When using a
warhammer in close combat a roll of 2-4 is
treated as stunned when rolling on the Injury
chart.
Holy Weapon: Each warhammer is blessed by
the High Matriarch herself before it is handed to
the Sisters. The warhammer has a +1 bonus on
all to wound rolls against any Possessed or
Undead models. Note that you will still need to
score a 6 before any modifiers in order to cause
a critical hit. Only Matriarchs and Sister
Superiors may carry two Sigmarite
warhammers.
steel whip
10 gold crowns
Availability: Common (Sisters of Sigmar only).
Another weapon unique to the Sisterhood is the
steel whip, made from barbed steel chains. 
Range Strength Special rules
Close Com As user Cannot be parried, whipcrack
SPECIAL RULES
Cannot be parried: The steel whip is a flexible
weapon and the Priestesses use it with great
expertise. Attempts to parry its strikes are futile.
A model attacked by a steel whip may not make
parries with swords or bucklers.
Whipcrack: when the wielder charges they gain
+1A for that turn. This bonus attack is added
after any other modifications. When the wielder
is charged they gain +1A that they may only use
against the charger. This additional attack will
‘strike first’. If the wielder is simultaneously
charged by two or more opponents they will
still only receive a total of +1A. If the wielder is
using two whips at the same time then they get
+1A for the additional hand weapon, but only
the first whip gets the whipcrack +1A.

Count Vlad von Carstein
and his wife Isabella have
ruled the province of
Sylvania for as long as anyone can
remember – peasants whisper of
some dark secret, Witch Hunters revile
them, and the Priests of Sigmar shun their
court. Indeed, Sylvania has the most dire
reputation of all the provinces of the Empire. Few
men sent to spy on the rulers of Sylvania have ever
returned from those dark Sylvanian forests, and then
rarely with their sanity intact.
In the dimly-lit chamber of the Drakenhof castle, on a
throne of black obsidian, sits Vlad von Carstein, the
ruler of Sylvania. He waits in shadows, having set
himself apart from the politics and bickering of the
Empire. For he holds a terrible secret: he, and all the
ruling aristocracy of his province are Vampires,
undying monsters from beyond the grave. Here he
patiently waits, drinking the blood of maidens from
gold goblets.
For many long years Vlad has gathered his strength
and mustered his Undead legions in secrecy. One day
soon he will march from the forests of
Sylvania at the head of an army of
restless dead. The pieces of magic
stone that lie scattered among
the ruins of Mordheim
can give the Count
the power to
challenge the nobles
of the Empire and
enslave the men of the
Old World.
Wyrdstone holds enough captured magical energy to
unleash a great spell of doom to rival that of Nagash
the Black. If the Count is successful, he will raise all
the dead between the Worlds Edge Mountains and the
borders of Stirland, and go to war against the divided
rulers of the Empire. His plans laid out, Vlad sends his
thralls, the immortal Vampires, to do his bidding.
During dark, moonless nights, black coaches arrive at
the gates of Mordheim carrying coffins. Ghouls scuttle
from their hiding places to greet them, and corpses
are stirred by a command which the living cannot
hear. Following the commands of the Vampire, they
hunt for shards of wyrdstone.
The night belongs to the Undead, and in Mordheim it
is always night.

“‘All who profit from the spoils of Chaos shalt be
doomed.’ So quoth Grand Theogonist Vilgrim the
Third,” Marius said vehemently. “I am not a looter
or a thief!”
“It’s been three weeks now, Marius!” Hensel
argued bitterly. “We’ve run out of money. We need
more men, we need new weapons. For Sigmar’s
sake, Marius, we’ll all starve!” Hensel paused for a
moment, and a sly look entered his dark brown
eyes. “That broken vault is there, and someone will
find it. Others, less righteous than us, will be
looking for it. Would you see the wealth of the
Empire stolen by wicked creatures or men of no
moral virtue. At least we’ll be spending it to
further our noble cause!”
As the two spoke, Enderlin, one of Lapzig’s men,
came around the corner, clearly excited.
“We’ve found the merchant’s house. The vault is
there, alright!” he told them with a grin. “We better
be quick, and grab the hoard before there’s any
trouble.” With that he hurried off again, the Witch
Hunter and Hensel following.
Enderlin led them down a narrow alleyway,
choked with debris. At the far end, where the alley
opened onto a wider street, a skeleton hung from a
gibbet, its rusted metal creaking as the cadaver
swung in the stale wind. A corner of a nearby
building had broken through its foundations and
within the dark confines of the exposed cellar gold
glinted in the dim light.
“We’ll be taking that!” a voice called out, and from
the shadows stepped a dozen men, some carrying
crossbows, the others wielding swords and spears.
They were all well dressed, in the manner of
Marienburgers.
“Dare not oppose me!” cried Marius, pulling forth
his own blade. “I am sent here by Sigmar himself.
Cross my path and be forever damned. The world
around us is in turmoil, Chaos gnaws upon the
bones of our lands, foul creatures lurk in our once
proud cities. Men should not fight men in these
troubled times, for have we not a common foe to
fight against?”
“All the same, that gold is ours!” their leader
replied, signalling his men to advance.
“Then so be it, you shall be in the arms of
damnation before the sun sets!” Marius snarled
back, leaping to the attack.

0-1 Necromancer

Necromancers are evil wizards, studying the corrupt
art of Necromancy. Many of them are acolytes and
servants of Vlad von Carstein, and follow the agents of
their master to the city of the Damned. Others are
recruited from amongst wizards and warlocks who
have come under the suspicion of the various agents
of Sigmar and have fled to Mordheim to avoid
persecution.

0-3 Dregs
20 gold crowns to hire
Dregs are the most miserable human
survivors of the demise of Mordheim.
They are deformed and rejected
individuals, shunned even by the other men and
women who still live in the ruins and catacombs of
the city.
Vampires often recruit Dregs as their servants and
treat them with surprising kindness. As a result, Dregs
are often fanatically loyal to their Undead overlords
and will do anything to protect and serve them.
Dregs are very useful to their masters as they can be
sent to buy equipment, weapons and supplies from
the settlements around Mordheim which would often
not welcome Necromancers or where Vampires
would fall under the suspicion of the Witch Hunters.
They can also do the bidding of their vampiric master
during daylight, when the Vampires must rest in their
coffins.

Ghouls are the descendants of evil and insane men
who ate the flesh of the dead. When the lean and
hungry times of famine come upon the Old World, the
most depraved and destitute took to feasting on
corpses to survive. 
Driven by their unspeakable craving for the meat of
their fellow men, these creatures have given up their
human life and dwell near graveyards, crypts and
tombs, digging up the rotting corpses of the recently
buried and consuming the cold flesh with their bare
teeth and claws. 
The destruction of Mordheim attracted many Ghoul
clans from the north, and now they have taken up
permanent residence in the crypts and cemeteries of
the ruined city.

upon mankind. For centuries they have been content
to feed upon his ruins, to seed plague in his cities,
and spread contagion amongst his lands. At least they
were content to wait and watch, for now everything
has suddenly changed. Now the destruction of
Mordheim has created new opportunities in the
secret war against mankind. 
Since ancient times the Skaven have searched the
world for the stones of power that men in their
ignorance call wyrdstone but which Skaven have long
since known as warpstone, blackstone, or seerstone.
It was as a result of gnawing upon this magic stone in
ages past that commonplace rats began the slow
process of mutation that spawned the Skaven race.
Wyrdstone is quite literally in their blood, for they
feed upon it and make use of it in their foul sorceries.
Until now the ratmen’s search for wyrdstone has been
difficult and time-consuming as the stone has grown
increasingly rare, but now a new and abundant
source has appeared – a dark blessing from the skies! 
For the Skaven of Clan Eshin, this is an especially
opportune time for such a thing to happen, for, just
as the Empire is divided, so the Skaven race is divided
amongst itself. Clan fights clan the world over, each
struggling for domination of the Council of Thirteen
whose masters rule the Skaven race. Mordheim’s
secret is not yet revealed to all the clans, or else the
City of the Damned would already be overrun with
ratmen. The Nightmaster of Clan Eshin is keen to
guard this secret, and for this reason has not sent his
multitudinous armies into Mordheim. Instead, he has
sent small warbands of Skaven skittering through
secret tunnels into the city to gather up the shining
stones and bring them back to the clan nests.
The Skaven of Clan Eshin are supremely adapted to
their task. Masters of the art of bringing silent death to
their foes, they are skilled in the use of poison and
trained in the thousand secrets of the assassin.
Since birth Skaven warriors practise martial crafts in
the ruinous temples of the Horned Rat, their ever-
hungering and hideous god. There are none better
amongst their verminous kind to gather up the
treasure of Mordheim, but they must be silent, swift
and efficient. Were rival Skaven clans to discover
the secret of Mordheim there would come not
hundreds, not thousands, but millions upon
millions to contend for the wyrdstone in the City
of the Damned.
Unbeknownst to man,
for thousands of years he has
shared his world with another
and altogether different race.
There have always been signs
for those who cared to see
them: a scurrying black
shadow, an inhuman scream
from the sewer, scuttling
shapes at the back of the cellar.
All these years these creatures have worked
away in secret, burrowing beneath the world of man,
undermining his great cities, infiltrating his sewers
and cellars, and joining all up into a vast world-
spanning labyrinth of tunnels and nests. These
creatures call themselves Skaven and they are
ratmen, the mutant spawn of an older age of
chaos and mutation. 
Doubtless one day the
Skaven will be ready to
emerge from their
tunnels and wage
open war

blowpipe
25 gold crowns
Availability: Rare 7, Skaven only
The blowpipe is a short hollow tube which can be
used to shoot poisoned darts. While the darts by
themselves are too small to cause significant damage,
the poison used by the Skaven can cause searing
agony and eventual death.
The other advantage of a blowpipe is that it is silent,
and a well-hidden shooter can fire the darts
undetected.
Range Strength Save modifier Special rules
8" 1 +1 Poison, Stealthy
SPECIAL RULES
Poison: The needles fired by
a blowpipe are coated in a
venom very similar in its
effects to the Black Lotus (if
you roll a 6 on the To Hit
roll, the victim is
automatically wounded). A blowpipe cannot cause
critical hits. This weapon has a positive armour save
modifier, so a model that normally has a save of 5+
will get a save of 4+ against a blowpipe dart. Even
models that normally do not have an armour save
will get a 6+ save to take into account protection
offered by clothes, fur or the like.
Stealthy: A Skaven armed with a blowpipe can fire
while hidden without revealing his position to the
enemy. The target model can take an Initiative test in
order to try to spot the firing Skaven. If the test is
successful, the Skaven no longer counts as hidden.
warplock pistol
35 gold crowns (70 for a brace)
Availability: Rare 11, Skaven only
Warplock pistols are terrifying weapons, testimony to
the mad genius of Clan Skryre engineers. Warplock
pistols shoot ammunition made of magically treated
warpstone and wounds caused by warplock pistols
are horrible to behold and often cause infections.
Range Strength Save modifier Special rules
8" 5 -3 Fire every other

The martial arts practised by Clan Eshin employ many
unusual weapons. The most famous of these are the
Eshin Fighting Claws: sharp metal blades attached to
the paws of a Skaven warrior. It takes a real expert to
use them effectively, but an adept of Clan Eshin is a
fearsome opponent when armed this way.

Skaven special skills
Skaven
30
Skaven Heroes may choose to use the
following Skill list instead of any of the standard Skill tables available to them.
black hunger
The Skaven can draw upon the dreaded Black Hunger, the fighting frenzy which gives him
unnatural strength and speed but can ravage him from inside. The Skaven Hero may
declare at the beginning of his turn that he is using this skill. The Hero may add +1
attack and +D3" to the total move to his profile for the duration of his own turn
but will suffer D3 S3 hits with no armour save possible at the end of the
turn.
tail fighting
The Skaven may wield a shield, knife or a sword with its tail. The
model gains an extra attack with the appropriate weapon or a +1
bonus to its armour save.
wall runner
The Skaven does not need to take an Initiative test when
climbing up walls and other sheer surfaces.
infiltration
A Skaven with this skill is always placed on the battlefield
after the opposing warband and can be placed anywhere
on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing
warband and more than 12" away from any enemy model. 
If both players have models which infiltrate, roll a D6 for
each, and the lowest roll sets up first.
art of silent death
The Skaven has patiently mastered the deadly art of
open-hand fighting, as taught by the mystics of Cathay in
the temples of the far East. In hand-to-hand combat, the
Skaven can fight with his bare paws without any
penalties and counts as having two weapons (ie, +1
attack). In addition, a Skaven Hero with this skill will
cause a critical hit on a To Wound roll of 5-6 instead of
just 6. This skill may be used in conjunction with the
Eshin Fighting Claws (+2 Attacks instead of +1).
